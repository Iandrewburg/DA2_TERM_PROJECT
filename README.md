The Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) is one of the most observed bird species in the U.S., commonly found in backyards and well-recognized nationwide1. It is referred to as a ‘backyard’ bird species, which means it is very commonly found in rural and urbanized habitats. This study investigates how human populations and urban development are associated with Northern Cardinal observation frequencies in U.S. counties. Given their adaptation to certain human-developed areas for food sourcing, this research examines the effect of urban development and population density on observation incidence. Focusing on 2022 data, the study analyses County-Level Rural-Urban Continuum Codes, Urban Influence Codes, Economic Typology, Natural Rate of Change, and Immigration Rates. The questions this research project aims to address are: What effect does urbanization have on Northern Cardinal sightings in the U.S.? It hypothesizes that more developed counties will record higher Northern Cardinal observations.
